# LeagueCrawlerProject

Project for my master thesis in order to fetch a set of games from four major regions Korea, EU West, Brazil and North America.
Core functionalities lie in CrawlGames.py and Lib.Crawler.py

The project at hand also inhibits some ETL-scripts for transforming documents from MongoDB to atomic records in preperation to get inserted into a Relational Database System (in this case MariaDB)
